<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="Introduction"> Introduction</a></h2>

The topics covered in this chapter are intended to give you some helpful
programming hints as you begin to develop your OpenGL applications.  Note that
these hints are specific to HP's implementation of OpenGL.  For further
information on OpenGL programming hints that are not HP specific, see Appendix
G in the <i><a href="../AddisonWesley.html">OpenGL Programming Guide</a></i>
and section 6.6 "Maximizing OpenGL Performance" in the <i><a
href="../AddisonWesley.html">OpenGL Programming for the X Window
System</a></i> manual.

<p>
The programming hints in this chapter are covered in these sections:

<ul type=disc>
<li>OpenGL Correctness Hints
<li>OpenGL Performance Hints
</ul>


<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="OpenGLCorrectnessHints"> OpenGL Correctness Hints</a></h2>

Hints provided in this section are intended to help you correctly use HP's
implementation of OpenGL.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="FourDValues"> 4D Values</a></h3>

When specifying 4D values, such as vertices, light positions, etc, if possible
supply a <tt>w</tt> value that is not near the floating point limits of
<tt>MINFLOAT</tt> or <tt>MAXFLOAT</tt>.  Using <tt>w</tt> values near the
floating point limits increases the likelihood of floating point precision
errors in calculations such as lighting, transformations, and perspective
division.

<p>
Also, performance will be best when 4D positions are normalized such that
<tt>w</tt> is 1.0.

<p>
For best accuracy and performance, if you want to specify some 4D position
like <nobr>(0.0, 0.0, 5e10, 1.5e38)</nobr>, instead use the equivalent
normalized position <nobr>(0.0, 0.0, 3.33e-28, 1.0)</nobr>.

<p>
If a light position must be specified with a <tt>w</tt> value that is near the
floating point limits, consider setting

<pre>
HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE=EC
</pre>

to ensure that lighting occurs in Eye Space.  This will eliminate an extra
transformation of the light position, giving the best possible solution.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="TextureCoordinates"> Texture Coordinates</a></h3>

When using non-orthographic projection, keep in mind the texture coordinates
will be divided by <tt>w</tt> as an intermediate calculation.  HP's
implementation of OpenGL estimates that for VMD, the texture coordinates used
in perspective projections will have only five significant digits of
precision.  Therefore, when you have texturing close to a window edge and the
decomposition of the primitive causes the vertices to have very closely-spaced
texture coordinates after perspective projection, you may see loss of
texturing precision.  This loss of precision may make the texture primitive
seem locally smeared.


<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="OpenGLPerformanceHints"> OpenGL Performance Hints</a></h2>

Hints provided in this section are intended to help improve your applications
performance when using HP's implementation of OpenGL.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="DisplayListPerformance"> Display List Performance</a></h3>

The topics covered here are areas where you can gain substantial improvements
in program performance when using OpenGL display lists.  Here is a list of the
topics that are covered:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Geometric Primitives
<li>GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE Mode
<li>Textures
<li>State Changes and their Effects on Display Lists
<li>Regular Primitive Data.
</ul>


<h4><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="GeometricPrimitives"> Geometric Primitives</a></h4>

Geometric primitives will typically be faster if put in a display list.  As a
general rule, larger primitives will be faster than smaller ones.  Performance
gains here can be dramatic.  For example, it is possible that a single
<tt>GL_TRIANGLES</tt> primitive with 20 or so triangles will render three
times faster than 20 <tt>GL_TRIANGLES</tt> primitives with a single triangle
in each one.


<h4><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="GLCOMPILEandEXECUTEMode"> GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE Mode</a></h4>

Due to the pre-processing of the display list, and execution performance
enhancements, creating a display list using the
<tt>GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE</tt> mode will reduce program performance.  If you
need to improve your programs performance, do not create a display list using
the <tt>GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE</tt> mode.  You will find that it is easier and
faster to create the display list using the <tt>GL_COMPILE</tt> mode, and then
execute the list after it is created.


<h4><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="Textures"> Textures</a></h4>

If calls to <tt>glTexImage</tt> are put into a display list, they may be
cached.  Note that if you are going to use the same texture multiple times,
you may gain better performance if you put the texture in a display list.
Another solution would be to use texture objects.  Since 3D textures can
potentially become very large, they <i>are not</i> cached.

<h4><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="StateChangesAndTheirEffectsOnDisplayLists"> State Changes and their Effects on Display Lists</a></h4>

If there are several state changes in a row, it is possible, in some
circumstances, for the display list to optimize them.

<p>
It is more efficient to put a state change before a <tt>glBegin</tt>, than
after it.  For example, this is always more efficient:

<pre>
    glColor3f(1,2,3);
    glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
    glVertex3f(...);
    ... many more vertices ...
    glEnd();
</pre>

than this:

<pre>
    glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
    glColor3f(1,2,3);
    glVertex3f(...);
    ... many more vertices ...
    glEnd();
</pre>


<h4><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="RegularPrimitiveData"> Regular Primitive Data</a></h4>

If the vertex data that you give to a display list is regular (i.e. every
vertex has the same data associated with it), it is possible for the display
list to optimize the primitive much more effectively than if the data is not
regular.

<p>
For example if you wanted to give only a single normal for each face in a
<tt>GL_TRIANGLES</tt> primitive, the most intuitive way to get the best
performance would look like this:

<pre>
    glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
    glNormal3fv(&v);
    glVertex3fv(&p1); glVertex3fv(&p2); glVertex3fv(&p3);
    glNormal3fv(&v);
    glVertex3fv(&p1); glVertex3fv(&p2); glVertex3fv(&p3);
    ...
    glEnd();
</pre>

In immediate mode, this would give you the best performance.  However, if you
are putting these calls into a display list, you will get <i>much</i> better
performance by duplicating the normal for each vertex, thereby giving
<i>regular</i> data to the display list:

<pre>
    glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
    glNormal3fv(&v); glVertex3fv(&p1);
    glNormal3fv(&v); glVertex3fv(&p2);
    glNormal3fv(&v); glVertex3fv(&p3);
    ...
    glEnd();
</pre>

The reason this is faster is the display list can optimize this type of
primitive into a single, very efficient structure.  The small cost of adding
extra data is offset by this optimization.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="TextureDownloadingPerformance"> Texture Downloading Performance</a></h3>

This section includes some helpful hints for improving the performance of your
program when downloading textures.

<ul type=disc>
<li>If you are downloading MIP maps, always begin with the base level (level
    0) first.

<li>If it is possible, you should use texture objects to store and bind
    textures.

<li>If you are doing dynamic downloading of texture maps, you will get better
    performance by replacing the current texture with a texture of the same
    width, height, border size, and format.  This should be done instead of
    deleting the old texture and creating a new one.
</ul>


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="SelectionPerformance"> Selection Performance</a></h3>

To increase the performance of selection (<tt>glRenderMode GL_SELECTION</tt>)
it is recommended that the following capabilities be disabled before entering
the selection mode.

<pre>
    GL_TEXTURE_*
    GL_TEXTURE_GEN_*
    GL_FOG
    GL_LIGHTING
</pre>


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="StateChange"> State Change</a></h3>

OpenGL state setting commands can be classified into to two different
categories.  The first category is <b>vertex-data</b> commands.  These are the
calls that can occur between a <tt>glBegin</tt>/<tt>glEnd</tt> pair:

<pre>
    glVertex
    glColor
    glIndex
    glNormal
    glEdgeFlag
    glMaterial
    glTexCoord
</pre>

The processing of these calls is very fast.  Restructuring a program to
eliminate some vertex data commands will not significantly improve
performance.

<p>
The second category is <b>modal state-setting</b> commands, or sometimes
referred to as "mode changes."  These are the commands that:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Turn on/off capabilities,
<li>Change attribute settings for capabilities,
<li>Define lights,
<li>Change matrices,
<li>etc.
</ul>

These calls cannot occur between a <tt>glBegin</tt>/<tt>glEnd</tt> pair.
Examples of such commands are:

<pre>
    glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);
    glFogf(GL_FOG_MODE, GL_LINEAR);
    glLightf(..);
    glLoadMatrixf(..);
</pre>

Changes to the modal state are significantly more expensive to process than
simple vertex-data commands.  Also, application performance can be optimized
by grouping modal-state changes, and by minimizing the number of modal-state
changes:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Grouping your state changes together (that is, several modal state changes
    at one time), and then rendering primitives, will provide better
    performance than doing the modal state changes one by one and intermixing
    them with primitives.
<p>
<li>Grouping primitives that require the same modal state together to minimize
    modal state changes.  For example, if only part of a scene's primitives
    are lighted, draw all the lighted primitives, then turn off lighting and
    draw all the unlighted primitives, rather than enabling/disabling lighting
    many times.
</ul>


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="LightingSpace"> Lighting Space</a></h3>

OpenGL specifies that lighting operations should be done in Eye Coordinate
space.  However, if the modelview matrix is isotropic, equivalent lighting
calculations can be performed in Object Coordinate Space, by transforming
stored light positions to Object Coordinates.  If there are many vertices
between modelview-matrix changes, Object Coordinate Space lighting is faster
than Eye Coordinate Space lighting since the transformation of vertices and
normals from object to Eye Coordinates can be skipped.

<p>
Whether or not Object Coordinate lighting is faster than Eye Coordinate
lighting depends on the command mode (immediate mode vs. execution of a
display list or vertex array) as well as the number of vertices between
modelview-matrix changes.

<p>
The selection of a lighting space occurs at the start of the next primitive
(<tt>glBegin</tt> or vertex array) after any GL calls that could affect the
choice of lighting space.  The choice of lighting space can be affected by
those GL calls that:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Change Object Coordinates to Eye Coordinates (modelview matrix)
<li>Turn on/off fog
<li>Turn on/off spherical-texture-coordinate generation.
</ul>

If the modelview matrix is anisotropic, lighting must be done in Eye
Coordinates.  Lighting will also be done in eye coordinates when fogging and
spherical-texture-coordinate generation are done in Eye Coordinates.

<p>
If none of the above conditions which force Eye Coordinate Lighting are true,
then HP's implementation of OpenGL chooses the lighting space depending on how
OpenGL commands are being executed at the time a choice must be made.  If
commands are being executed in immediate mode, Eye Space Lighting is chosen.
If commands are being executed from a display list or if a vertex array is
being executed, object space lighting is chosen.

<p>
Eye Space Lighting works well when commands are executed in immediate mode,
and Object Space Lighting works well when:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>There are many (8 or more) vertices between changes to light definitions
    or to the modelview matrix.

<li>A display list or vertex array is used.
</ul>

You can override the above lighting space selection rules by setting the
environment variable <tt>HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE</tt>. To set this environment
variable, execute the following command:

<pre>
    export HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE=EC
</pre>

when any of the following are true:

<ul type=disc>
<li>The application uses display lists or vertex arrays, but makes frequent
    changes to the modelview matrix or to light definitions (using
    <tt>glLight()</tt>).

<li>The application uses display lists or vertex arrays, but frequently turns
    fogging or spherical-texture-coordinate generation on/off.

<li>The application uses 4D data (for example, vertices, light positions) and
    the <tt>w</tt> values are near the floating-point limits.  See the section
    above on 4D values for more information.
</ul>
  
It is appropriate to use

<pre>
    export HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE=OC
</pre>

when:

<ul type=disc>
<li>There are many (eight or more) vertices between light changes or
    modelview-matrix changes.

<li>Display lists or vertex arrays are used extensively.
</ul>

and any of the following are true:

<ul type=disc>
<li>There is alot of switching between immediate mode and display-list
    execution (or vertex arrays) while lighting is on, and intermixed with
    state changes that affect choice of lighting space (these were listed
    above).

<li>Display lists are used predominantly, but the first <tt>glBegin</tt> after
    commands that affect choice of lighting space (which were listed above) is
    an immediate mode command.
    
    <p>
    For example, in a scenario like the following:
    
    <pre>
    <img src="symbols/LAngle.xbm" alt="&lt;"><i>load a modelview matrix</i><img src="symbols/RAngle.xbm" alt="&gt;">
    <img src="symbols/LAngle.xbm" alt="&lt;"><i>define lights</i><img src="symbols/RAngle.xbm" alt="&gt;">
    <img src="symbols/LAngle.xbm" alt="&lt;"><i>enable lights and lighting</i><img src="symbols/RAngle.xbm" alt="&gt;">
    
    glBegin(...);  /* Some simple immediate mode rendering.
                    * Lighing space gets chosen at this point. */
    ...
    glEnd();
    
    <img src="symbols/LAngle.xbm" alt="&lt;"><i>execution of many display lists or vertex arrays,
    with no changes to the modelview matrix or light definitions</i><img src="symbols/RAngle.xbm" alt="&gt;">
    </pre>
    
    <p>
    Here the default-lighting space chosen at the time of the first
    <tt>glBegin</tt> is Eye Space Lighting.  The display lists could have
    benefited from setting <tt>HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE=OC</tt>.
</ul>

When tuning an application, first use just the default-lighting-space
selection (do not set <tt>HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE</tt>). If the application
matches the conditions listed above that indicate the need for setting
<tt>HPOGL_LIGHTING_SPACE</tt>, then experiment with setting the environment
variable.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="OptimizationOfLighting"> Optimization of Lighting</a></h3>

HP's implementation of OpenGL optimizes the lighting case such that the
performance degradation from one light to two or more lights is linear.
Lighting performance does not degrade noticeably when you enable a second
light.  In addition, the <tt>GL_SHININESS</tt> material parameter is not
particularly expensive to change.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="OcclusionCulling"> Occlusion Culling</a></h3>

The proper use of HP's occlusion culling extension can dramatically improve
rendering performance.  This extension defines a mechanism for determining the
non-visibility of complex geometry based on the non-visibility of a bounding
geometry.  This feature can greatly reduce the amount of geometry processing
and rendering required by an application, thereby, increasing the applications
performance.  For more information on occlusion culling, see the section "<a
href="01_Overview.html#OcclusionExtension">Occlusion
Extension</a>" found in Chapter 1.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="RescalingNormals"> Rescaling Normals</a></h3>

When normal rescaling is enabled, a new operation is added to the
transformation of the normal vector into eye coordinates.  The normal vector
is rescaled after it is multiplied by the inverse modelview matrix and before
it is normalized.

<p>
The rescale factor is chosen so that in many cases, normal vectors with unit
length in object coordinates will not need to be normalized as they are
transformed into eye coordinates.

<p>
As of Release 1.05 of HP's implementation of OpenGL 1.1, the
<tt>GL_RESCALE_NORMAL_EXT</tt> token is supported.  It is accepted by the
<nobr><img src="symbols/LAngle.xbm" alt="&lt;"><i>cap</i><img
src="symbols/RAngle.xbm" alt="&gt;"></nobr> parameter of <a
href="../Reference/glEnable.html">glEnable</a>, <a
href="../Reference/glEnable.html">glDisable</a>, and <a
href="../Reference/glIsEnabled.html">glIsEnabled</a>, and by the <nobr><img
src="symbols/LAngle.xbm" alt="&lt;"><i>pname</i><img
src="symbols/RAngle.xbm" alt="&gt;"></nobr> parameter of <a
href="../Reference/glGet.html">glGetBooleanv</a>, <a
href="../Reference/glGet.html">glGetIntegerv</a>, <a
href="../Reference/glGet.html">glGetFloatv</a>, and <a
href="../Reference/glGet.html">glGetDoublev</a>.

<p>

Normals that have unit length when sent to the GL, have their length changed
by the inverse of the scaling factor after transformation by the model-view
inverse matrix when the model-view matrix represents a uniform scale. If
rescaling is enabled, then normals specified with the Normal command are
rescaled after transformation by the ModelView Inverse.

<p>
Normals sent to the GL may or may not have unit length.  In addition, the
length of the normals after transformation might be altered due to
transformation by the model-view inverse matrix.  If normalization is enabled,
then normals specified with the <a
href="../Reference/glNormal.html">glNormal3</a> command are normalized after
transformation by the model-view inverse matrix and after rescaling if
rescaling is enabled.  Normalization and rescaling are controlled with <a
href="../Reference/glEnable.html">glEnable</a> and <a
href="../Reference/glEnable.html">glDisable</a> with the target equal to
<tt>NORMALIZE</tt> or <tt>RESCALE_NORMAL</tt>.  This requires two bits of
state.  The initial state is for normals not to be normalized or rescaled.

<p>
Therefore, if the modelview matrix is M, the transformed plane equation is:

<p align=center>
<img src="equations/NsubXPrime.gif" border=0>

<p>
the rescaled normal is

<p align=center>
<img src="equations/NsubX2Prime.gif" border=0>

<p>
and the fully transformed normal is

<p>
<center>
<table border=0>
<tr><td><img src="equations/OneOverSqrt.gif" border=0></td>
    <td width=100></td>
    <td>(2.1)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>


<p>
If rescaling is disabled, <i>f</i> is 1, otherwise <i>f</i> is computed as
follows:

<p>
Let <i>m<sub>ij</sub></i> denote the matrix element in row <i>i</i> and column
<i>j</i> of <i>M</i><sup>-1</sup>, numbering the topmost row of the matrix as
row 1, and the leftmost column as column 1. Then

<p align=center>
<img src="equations/fdef1.gif" border=0>

<p>
Alternatively, an implementation my chose to normalize the normal instead of
rescaling the normal. Then

<p align=center>
<img src="equations/fdef2.gif" border=0>

<p>
If normalization is disabled, then the square root in equation 2.1 is replaced
with 1; otherwise, it is calculated as dictated by the OpenGL Spec.  If both
normalize and rescale are enabled, HP's implementation skips the rescale and
does only the normalize.
