<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="Introduction"> Introduction</a></h2>

This chapter gives a description of the Virtual GLX mode, Virtual Memory
Driver (VMD), and support of threaded applications.

<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="VirtualGLXMode"> Virtual GLX (VGL) Mode</a></h2>

Virtual GLX (VGL) defines a special transparent mode within HP's
implementation of OpenGL that allows an HP client to render through OpenGL to
X servers and/or X terminals that do not support OpenGL or the X server
extension for GLX.

<p>
This mode is implemented by emulating the X server extension within the OpenGL
API client-side library and using the HP Virtual Memory Driver (VMD) to
perform Xlib rendering.

<p>
VGL provides flexibility for OpenGL users, but does not provide the same level
of performance as is available to servers supporting GLX.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="VisualSupportForTheVGLMode"> Visual Support for the VGL Mode</a></h3>

In VGL mode, the visual capabilities incorporated in
<tt>glXChooseVisual()</tt> and <tt>glXGetConfig()</tt> are synthesized from
the list of X Visuals supported on the target X Server and the capabilities of
the Virtual Memory Driver (VMD).  Table 1-5 in Chapter 1 lists the X Visuals
that are supported through the OpenGL Extension to the X Window System (GLX)
in the Virtual GLX (VGL) mode.


<h3><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="SpecialConsiderations"> Special Considerations</a></h3>

When you are in the VGL mode, you will notice the following differences
between it and the GLX mode.

<ul type=disc>
<li>VGL deals with X servers that do <i>not</i> support replicated X visuals
    that provide extended GLX capabilities.  This results in a GLX visual list
    that is synthesized from available X visuals.  This list is assigned the
    maximum set of capabilities supported by the Virtual Memory Driver (VMD)
    for each particular visual.  For example, if a visual is found to be
    supported by the Double-Buffered Extension (DBE), then it will be reported
    as having the capability of doing double-buffering.  Note that there will
    <i>not</i> be a counterpart for the GLX visual with the same type and
    depth that is single buffered.  If a request is made for a single buffered
    visual, a double-buffered visual will match the request, but that visual
    will only be available for single-buffered rendering unless a new display
    connection is opened to the VGL display.<p>

<li>OpenGL and Xlib rendering when mixed and sent to the same drawable in VGL
    mode may behave differently than if a GLX capable X server were used.
    This is because in VGL mode OpenGL rendering is not strictly bounded by
    the limits of primitives rendered as is the case when a GLX server is
    used.  In fact, rendering a single GLX primitive can result in repainting
    the entire drawable.  This means that in the VGL mode it may not be safe
    to rely upon the fact that Xlib and OpenGL render to different regions of
    the drawable.  The best way to avoid this issue is to always perform Xlib
    rendering after OpenGL rendering.<p>

<li>The <tt>glReadPixels</tt> routine when used in the VGL mode will return
    only pixel data rendered via OpenGL.  Xlib rendering will <i>not</i> be
    included.<p>

<li>A call to <tt>glXSwapBuffers</tt> is the only approved way to achieve
    double buffering for VGL visuals.  Note that calls made to
    <tt>XdbeSwapBuffers</tt> will not work correctly.<p>

<li>A call can be made to:
    <pre>
    Bool hpglXDisplayIsVGL(Display *dpy,
                           int     screen)
    </pre>
    to determine if a particular display connection is operating in VGL mode.
    The return value is "True" if <tt>dpy</tt> is VGL; otherwise, the value
    returned is "False."  This is an HP function that is not available on
    other implementations of OpenGL.
</ul>


<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="TheVirtualMemoryDriver"> The Virtual Memory Driver (VMD)</a></h2>

Instead of rendering OpenGL graphics to a dedicated graphics-display
subsystem, VMD is designed to render these images to a virtual-memory frame
buffer and send these images to an X11 drawable using standard X11 protocol.

<p>
Because HP VMD uses the X11 protocol to display the images, this targeted
drawable may be local or remote.  This may include rendering to X terminals,
older HP devices, or a personal computer.  The only requirement is that the
output is directed to an X11 drawable.  (See <a
href="01_Overview.html">Chapter 1</a> for a list of supported VMD
configurations) VMD is also the driver used to render to GLX pixmaps.

<p>
When a GLX context is created for rendering three-dimensional graphics using
OpenGL, GLX first checks to see if the X server supports the GLX extension.
If it does not, the Virtual Memory Driver will be used.  GLX examines the
available list of X visuals and decides which ones can be software extended to
be GLX visuals (see the supported visuals list).  Buffers are allocated in
virtual memory for the OpenGL color and ancillary buffers.  When the
application issues a <tt>glFlush()</tt>, <tt>glFinish()</tt>, or a
<tt>glXSwapBuffers()</tt> call, the contents of the corresponding
virtual-memory-color buffers are sent to the X11 window using X protocol.

<p>
Double buffering for VMD is implemented using the X11 Double-Buffering
Extension (DBE).  Double-buffered visuals are not available for HP OpenGL
rendering with VMD on X servers that do not support DBE.

<p>
Because of the way VMD works (rendering to a VM buffer and then displaying the
images through X11 protocol), it will behave a bit differently than hardware
devices.  In particular, since VMD renders to VM buffers, changes to the X11
window will not appear until a buffer swap or a
<tt>glFlush</tt>/<tt>glFinish</tt>.

<p>
Resource usage needs to be taken into consideration,as well.  VM buffers are
allocated for all of the OpenGL color and ancillary buffers.  Color buffers
are allocated when the context is created.  Other buffers (depth, stencil,
accumulation) are allocated at first use.  These buffers can be quite large.

<p>
For example, consider an X11 window 750 pixels wide and 600 pixels high.  The
size of each VM color buffer for an 8-bit visual is:

<p align=center>
(750 <img src="symbols/Times.xbm"> 600) pixels <img
src="symbols/Times.xbm"> 1 byte/pixel = 450,000 bytes

<p>
Consider that an OpenGL application may use two color buffers (for double
buffering), a 32-bit depth/stencil buffer, and a 48-bit accumulation buffer.
The size of the virtual memory required then becomes 5,400,000 bytes.  In
addition, the amount of virtual memory required is correspondingly larger for
12-bit and 24-bit color buffers.


<h2><a href="#TOC"><img  src="../buttons/ArrowUp.gif" alt="[Up]" border=0></a><a name="RunningHPsImplementationOfTheOpenGLStereoApplication"> Running HP's Implementation of the OpenGL Stereo Application</a></h2>

With HP's implementation of OpenGL and the V<font size=-1>ISUALIZE</font>-FX
family of graphics devices, it is now possible to run HP's implementation of
OpenGL "stereo in a window" mode.  Unlike previous HP stereo implementations,
"stereo in a window" affects only OpenGL windows that have been created with
"stereo capable" <tt>GLX</tt> visuals.  The remainder of the X11 screen is
rendered in non-stereo mode without any flickering or color artifacts.

<p>
Following are the steps required to run HP's implementation of OpenGL "stereo
in a window" mode:

<ol> 
<li>Find out if your monitor is currently configured in a mode that supports
    stereo.  This can be done by running the command:
    <pre>
    export DISPLAY=myhost:x.y
    /opt/graphics/OpenGL/contrib/xglinfo/xglinfo
    </pre>

    The output from <tt>xglinfo</tt> lists the OpenGL capabilities of the
    specified X Display, and includes all <tt>GLX</tt> visuals that are
    supported. If one or more of the listed <tt>GLX</tt> visuals are marked as
    stereo capable, then you can proceed to step three.<p>

<li>If none of the <tt>GLX</tt> visuals support stereo, you will need to
    re-configure your monitor to a configuration that supports stereo.  Note
    that you can use the "Monitor Configuration" component of SAM to
    re-configure you monitor, or you can execute the following command:
    <pre>
    /opt/graphics/common/bin/setmon <i>graphics device</i>
    </pre>

    Note that <i>graphics device</i> is a name such as "<tt>/dev/crt</tt>"
    that is included on the <tt>Screen</tt> line in the
    <tt>/etc/X11/X*screens</tt> file for the X Server that you want to
    configure for stereo.  The <tt>setmon</tt> command is interactive and will
    present you with the possible monitor configurations allowable for the
    specified device. You should select one of the configurations that is
    listed by <tt>setmon</tt> as stereo capable.  If none of the
    configurations indicate stereo capability, then your graphics device
    cannot be used for OpenGL stereo rendering.

    <p>
    After successfully re-configuring your monitor, the X Server will be
    restarted, and you can verify the availability of GLX stereo visuals by
    running the <tt>xglinfo</tt> command again.<p>

<li>To select one of the stereo  capable <tt>GLX</tt> visuals through
    OpenGL, the <tt>GLX_STEREO</tt> enumerated type should be passed to either
    <tt>glXChooseVisual()</tt> or <tt>glXGetConfig()</tt>.  Once a stereo
    visual has been selected, it can be used to create a stereo window,
    and <tt>glDrawBuffer()</tt> can then be called to utilize both the
    right and left buffers for rendering stereo images.
</ol>
